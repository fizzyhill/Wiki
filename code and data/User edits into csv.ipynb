      "In 1892, Pulitzer, a Hungarian-born newspaper magnate, offered Columbia University President [[Seth Low]] funding to establish the world's first school of journalism. He sought to elevate a profession viewed more often as a common trade learned through an apprenticeship. His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

      "Pulitzer was set on creating his vision at Columbia and offered it a $2&nbsp;million gift, one-quarter of which was to be used to establish prizes in journalism and the arts. It took years of negotiations and Pulitzer's death in October 1911 to finalize plans. On September 30, 1912, classes began with 79 undergraduate and postgraduate students, including a dozen women. Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march. A student from China went undercover to report on a downtown cocaine den. A journalism building was constructed the following year at Broadway and 116th Street on the western end of the campus.\n",

      "In 1935, Dean [[Carl W. Ackerman|Carl Ackerman]], a 1913 alumnus, led the school's transition to become the first graduate school of journalism in the United States. As the school's reach and reputation spread, due in part to distinguished early scholars who included [[Douglas Southall Freeman]], [[Walter B. Pitkin]] and [[Henry F. Pringle]], it began offering coursework in television news and documentary in addition to its focus on newspapers and radio. The [[Maria Moors Cabot Prizes]], the oldest international awards in journalism, were founded in 1938, honoring reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Awards for excellence in broadcast journalism was created in 1942. In 1958, the Columbia Journalism Award, the school's highest honor, was established to recognize an person of overarching accomplishment and distinguished service to journalism. Three years later, the school began publishing the ''Columbia Journalism Review''.<ref name=CJS_History>{{cite web | author= | title=Columbia Journalism School: History | url=https://journalism.columbia.edu/columbia-journalism-school#Our_History | publisher=Columbia University | year=2016 | accessdate=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref>\n",

By the 1970s, the Reporting and Writing 1 (RW1) course had become the cornerstone of the school's basic curriculum.

The Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism, dedicated to training select students interested in pursuing careers in investigative journalism, opened in 2006.

Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march.

Pringle]], it began offering coursework in television news and documentary in addition to its focus on newspapers and radio. The [[Maria Moors Cabot Prizes]], the oldest international awards in journalism, were founded in 1938, honoring reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Awards for excellence in broadcast journalism was created in 1942.

He sought to elevate a profession viewed more often as a common trade learned through an apprenticeship. His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

      "Pulitzer was set on creating his vision at Columbia and offered it a $2 million gift, one-quarter of which was to be used to establish prizes in journalism and the arts. It took years of negotiations and Pulitzer's death in October 1911 to finalize plans. On September 30, 1912, classes began with 79 undergraduate and postgraduate students, including a dozen women. Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march. A student from China went undercover to report on a downtown cocaine den. A journalism building was constructed the following year at Broadway and 116th Street on the western end of the campus.\n",

      "In 1892, Pulitzer, a Hungarian-born newspaper magnate, offered Columbia University President [[Seth Low]] funding to establish the world's first school of journalism. He sought to elevate a profession viewed more often as a common trade learned through an apprenticeship. His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

      "Pulitzer was set on creating his vision at Columbia and offered it a $2 million gift, one-quarter of which was to be used to establish prizes in journalism and the arts. It took years of negotiations and Pulitzer's death in October 1911 to finalize plans. On September 30, 1912, classes began with 79 undergraduate and postgraduate students, including a dozen women. Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march. A student from China went undercover to report on a downtown cocaine den. A journalism building was constructed the following year at Broadway and 116th Street on the western end of the campus.\n",

      "In 1935, Dean [[Carl W. Ackerman|Carl Ackerman]], a 1913 alumnus, led the school's transition to become the first graduate school of journalism in the United States. As the school's reach and reputation spread, due in part to distinguished early scholars who included [[Douglas Southall Freeman]], [[Walter B. Pitkin]] and [[Henry F. Pringle]], it began offering coursework in television news and documentary in addition to its focus on newspapers and radio. The [[Maria Moors Cabot Prizes]], the oldest international awards in journalism, were founded in 1938, honoring reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Awards for excellence in broadcast journalism was created in 1942. In 1958, the Columbia Journalism Award, the school's highest honor, was established to recognize an person of overarching accomplishment and distinguished service to journalism. Three years later, the school began publishing the ''Columbia Journalism Review''.<ref name=CJS_History>{{cite web | author= | title=Columbia Journalism School: History | url=https://journalism.columbia.edu/columbia-journalism-school#Our_History | publisher=Columbia University | year=2016 | accessdate=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref>\n",

The Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism, dedicated to training select students interested in pursuing careers in investigative journalism, opened in 2006.

His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march.

He sought to elevate a profession viewed more often as a common trade learned through an apprenticeship. His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

      "Pulitzer was set on creating his vision at Columbia and offered it a $2 million gift, one-quarter of which was to be used to establish prizes in journalism and the arts. It took years of negotiations and Pulitzer's death in October 1911 to finalize plans. On September 30, 1912, classes began with 79 undergraduate and postgraduate students, including a dozen women. Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march. A student from China went undercover to report on a downtown cocaine den. A journalism building was constructed the following year at Broadway and 116th Street on the western end of the campus.\n",

Pringle]], it began offering coursework in television news and documentary in addition to its focus on newspapers and radio. The [[Maria Moors Cabot Prizes]], the oldest international awards in journalism, were founded in 1938, honoring reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean.

His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march.

He sought to elevate a profession viewed more often as a common trade learned through an apprenticeship. His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

      "Pulitzer was set on creating his vision at Columbia and offered it a $2 million gift, one-quarter of which was to be used to establish prizes in journalism and the arts. It took years of negotiations and Pulitzer's death in October 1911 to finalize plans. On September 30, 1912, classes began with 79 undergraduate and postgraduate students, including a dozen women. Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march. A student from China went undercover to report on a downtown cocaine den. A journalism building was constructed the following year at Broadway and 116th Street on the western end of the campus.\n",

As the school's reach and reputation spread, due in part to distinguished early scholars who included [[Douglas Southall Freeman]], [[Walter B. Pitkin]] and [[Henry F. Pringle]], it began offering coursework in television news and documentary in addition to its focus on newspapers and radio. The [[Maria Moors Cabot Prizes]], the oldest international awards in journalism, were founded in 1938, honoring reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Awards for excellence in broadcast journalism was created in 1942.

The Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism, dedicated to training select students interested in pursuing careers in investigative journalism, opened in 2006.

      "In 1892, Pulitzer, a Hungarian-born newspaper magnate, offered Columbia University President [[Seth Low]] funding to establish the world's first school of journalism. He sought to elevate a profession viewed more often as a common trade learned through an apprenticeship. His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

      "Pulitzer was set on creating his vision at Columbia and offered it a $2 million gift, one-quarter of which was to be used to establish prizes in journalism and the arts. It took years of negotiations and Pulitzer's death in October 1911 to finalize plans. On September 30, 1912, classes began with 79 undergraduate and postgraduate students, including a dozen women. Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march. A student from China went undercover to report on a downtown cocaine den. A journalism building was constructed the following year at Broadway and 116th Street on the western end of the campus.\n",

      "In 1935, Dean [[Carl W. Ackerman|Carl Ackerman]], a 1913 alumnus, led the school's transition to become the first graduate school of journalism in the United States. As the school's reach and reputation for excellence soared, due in part to distinguished early scholars who included [[Douglas Southall Freeman]], [[Walter B. Pitkin]] and [[Henry F. Pringle]], it began offering coursework in television news and documentary in addition to its focus on newspapers and radio. The [[Maria Moors Cabot Prizes]], the oldest international awards in journalism, were founded in 1938, honoring reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Awards for excellence in broadcast journalism was created in 1942. In 1958, the Columbia Journalism Award, the school's highest honor, was established to recognize an individual of overarching accomplishment and distinguished service to journalism.

He sought to elevate a profession viewed more often as a common trade learned through an apprenticeship. His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

      "Pulitzer was set on creating his vision at Columbia and offered it a $2 million gift, one-quarter of which was to be used to establish prizes in journalism and the arts. It took years of negotiations and Pulitzer's death in October 1911 to finalize plans. On September 30, 1912, classes began with 79 undergraduate and postgraduate students, including a dozen women. Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march. A student from China went undercover to report on a downtown cocaine den. A journalism building was constructed the following year at Broadway and 116th Street on the western end of the campus.\n",

As the school's reach and reputation for excellence soared, due in part to distinguished early scholars who included [[Douglas Southall Freeman]], [[Walter B. Pitkin]] and [[Henry F. Pringle]], it began offering coursework in television news and documentary in addition to its focus on newspapers and radio. The [[Maria Moors Cabot Prizes]], the oldest international awards in journalism, were founded in 1938, honoring reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Awards for excellence in broadcast journalism was created in 1942. In 1958, the Columbia Journalism Award, the school's highest honor, was established to recognize an individual of overarching accomplishment and distinguished service to journalism.

      "Pulitzer was set on creating his vision at Columbia and offered it a $2 million gift, one-quarter of which was to be used to establish prizes in journalism and the arts. It took years of negotiations and Pulitzer's death in October 1911 to finalize plans. On September 30, 1912, classes began with 79 undergraduate and postgraduate students, including a dozen women. Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march. A student from China went undercover to report on a downtown cocaine den. A journalism building was constructed the following year at Broadway and 116th Street on the western end of the campus.\n",

      "In 1935, Dean [[Carl W. Ackerman|Carl Ackerman]], a 1913 alumnus, led the school's transition to become the first graduate school of journalism in the United States. As the school's reach and reputation for excellence soared, due in part to distinguished early scholars who included [[Douglas Southall Freeman]], [[Walter B. Pitkin]] and [[Henry F. Pringle]], it began offering coursework in television news and documentary in addition to its focus on newspapers and radio. The [[Maria Moors Cabot Prizes]], the oldest international awards in journalism, were founded in 1938, honoring reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Awards for excellence in broadcast journalism was created in 1942. In 1958, the Columbia Journalism Award, the school's highest honor, was established to recognize an individual of overarching accomplishment and distinguished service to journalism. Three years later, the groundbreaking Columbia Journalism Review began publication.<ref>https://journalism.columbia.edu/columbia-journalism-school}</ref>\n",

By the 1970s, the Reporting and Writing 1 (RW1) course had become the cornerstone of the school's basic curriculum.

The Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism, dedicated to training select students interested in pursuing careers in investigative journalism, opened in 2006. A year later, the Spencer Fellowship was created to enable long-form reporting that deepens public understanding of education. The [[Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma]] relocated to Columbia in 2009 to improve media coverage of trauma, conflict and tragedy. In 2010, the Tow Center for Digital Journalism was created.

His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. \"It will impart knowledge - not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,\" Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the [[North American Review]].<ref name=NA_Review>{{cite magazine |last=Pulitzer |first=Joseph |year=1904 |title=Planning a School of Journalism—The Basic Concept in 1904 |url=http://centennial.journalism.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Joseph-Pulitzer-NAmerican-Review-19041.pdf |magazine=The North American Review  |volume=178 |issue=5|access-date=Aug 2, 2017}}</ref> The university was resistant to the idea.

Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news.

Veteran journalist [[Talcott Williams]] was installed as the school's director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by President [[William Howard Taft]], a sensational police murder trial and a women's suffrage march.
