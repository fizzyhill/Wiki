Gamergate controversy,638673251,2014-12-18T18:42:45Z,most widely-covered incidents made no mention of GamerGate hashtag and that is noted in numerous reliable sources
Gamergate controversy,638672523,2014-12-18T18:36:42Z,"rmv again per WP:UNDUE, outside the brief flurry of coverage the Day incident got, it is basically a footnote, the quote has received basically no other coverage"

Gamergate controversy,638670988,2014-12-18T18:23:31Z,these images and the quote give undue weight to these statements and incidents
Gamergate controversy,638670311,2014-12-18T18:17:23Z,"To say they are ""unwilling"" is ignoring reliably-sourced coverage of supporters going after harassment, unable is more in line with sources"
